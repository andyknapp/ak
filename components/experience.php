          <p>As a web developer at King Design I strive to deliver high-performing, accessible and SEO friendly sites to the end user. I write clean, semantic front and back-end code, specializing in WordPress development. For our clients, I take pride in fully customizing the administrative area of WordPress to meet their (sometimes complex) data structure and publishing needs.</p>
          <p>Sites I've worked on recently include; <a href="https://seakeeper.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seakeeper</a>, <a href="https://www.isapartners.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">ISA</a>, <a href="https://www.duncanhines.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Duncan Hines</a>, <a href="https://www.birdseye.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Birdseye</a>,

          <p>Being part of a small team has afforded me the opportunity to go beyond web development and influence aspects of the entire design & development process - from planning content architecture to post-launch traffic analysis & recommendations. When time allows, I enjoy writing posts for our blog. Here are a few of my posts; <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com/blog/defining-a-critical-css-workflow-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Defining a Critical CSS Workflow for WordPress</a>, <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com/blog/acf-gutenberg-blocks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ACF Guten Blocks</a>, and <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com/blog/scrolling-the-fold/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrolling & the Fold</a>. </p>

          <p>As I transitioned from an advertising professional to a self taught developer, this period in my career was invaluable as I was able to hone my skills (including design) by working on many small websites. Working in a freelance capacity, as well as a solo designer/developer for small clients provided a wide range of experience, and enabled me to improve my technical skills.</p>

            <p>I worked in the Advertising industry, Media Planning specifically, for over 10 years. This experience enabled me to develop skills such as client & team management, public speaking, and an analytical thought process. I strongly believe that my background in the fast-paced and demanding advertising agency world remains a valuable and relevant experience as it relates to my current work as a Web Developer.</p>
            <p>The last position I held in advertising was at maxus in NYC where I led a team working primarily on Church & Dwight consumer brands. In that role as a Partner, Group Planning Director, I was the senior client contact responsible for strategic development and implementation oversight.</p>
            <p>Over the course of my career, I gained extensive experience working in the digital advertising space, including social media strategy and custom program development, along with traditional media such as TV and print. Prior to my position at maxus, I worked at Mediaedge, MindShare and Brouillard Communications (all current or former WPP companies).</p>
