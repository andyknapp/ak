                <p>While a web developer at <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">King Design</a> I delivered high-performing, accessible and SEO friendly sites to a wide range of clients. Specializing in WordPress development, I not only focused on writing clean and semantic code for the end user, but also customizing the administrative side to meet a client's data structure and publishing needs, while empowering them to manage their site easily.</p>
                <p>Sites worked on include; <a href="https://seakeeper.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seakeeper</a>, <a href="https://www.isapartners.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ISA</a>, <a href="https://www.duncanhines.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Duncan Hines</a>, <a href="https://www.birdseye.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Birdseye</a>, <a href="https://www.bostonbaking.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boston Baking</a>, <a href="https://abx-films.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ABX</a> and <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">King Design</a>.</p>
                <p>Being part of a small team afforded me the opportunity to go beyond web development and influence aspects of the entire design & development process - from planning content architecture to post-launch traffic analysis & recommendations. I also had the opportunity to write several blog posts. Here are a few; <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com/blog/defining-a-critical-css-workflow-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Defining a Critical CSS Workflow for WordPress</a>, <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com/blog/acf-gutenberg-blocks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ACF Guten Blocks</a>, and <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com/blog/scrolling-the-fold/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrolling & the Fold</a>. </p>

              <p>Working as a freelance developer and a solo designer / developer was an invaluable experience for several reasons. During this time I was able to greatly improve my technical skills and understanding of how WordPress, and the web works. Finding and managing clients taught me how a site can play a crucial role for smaller businesses and entrepreneurs. The design work I did, while not my strongest skillset, positively influences how I approach development and UX decisions to this day.</p>

                <p>Over 10 years in the Advertising industry (Media Planning specifically) enabled me to develop strong client & team management skills, public speaking confidence, and an analytical thought process. I strongly believe that my background in the fast-paced and demanding advertising agency world remains a valuable and relevant experience as it relates to my current work as a Web Developer.</p>
                <p>The last position I held in advertising was at maxus in NYC where I led a team working primarily on Church & Dwight consumer brands. In that role as a Partner, Group Planning Director, I was the senior client contact responsible for strategic development and implementation oversight.</p>
                <p>Along with traditional media like TV and print, I spent a significant amount of time working in the digital advertising space, while it emerged as critical advertising channel. This went beyond banner ad network buys, and included social media strategy as well as custom program development. Prior to my position at maxus in NYC from 1/08 to 8/11, I worked at MindShare (Chicago 9/05 - 3/07), Mediaedge NYC (3/03 - 8/05), and Brouillard Communications (NYC 9/00 - 3/03). All of which are current or former WPP companies.</p>
