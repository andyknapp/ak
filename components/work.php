        <p>While a web developer at <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">King Design</a> I delivered high-performing, accessible and SEO friendly sites to a wide range of clients. Specializing in WordPress development, I not only focused on writing clean and semantic code for the end user, but also customizing the administrative side to meet a client's data structure and publishing needs, while empowering them to manage their site easily.</p>
        <p>Sites worked on recently include; <a href="https://seakeeper.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seakeeper</a>, <a href="https://www.isapartners.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ISA</a>, <a href="https://www.duncanhines.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Duncan Hines</a>, <a href="https://www.birdseye.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Birdseye</a>, <a href="https://www.bostonbaking.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boston Baking</a>, <a href="https://abx-films.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ABX</a> and <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">King Design</a>.</p>
        <p>Being part of a small team afforded me the opportunity to go beyond web development and influence aspects of the entire design & development process - from planning content architecture to post-launch traffic analysis & recommendations. I also had the opportunity to write several blog posts. Here are a few; <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com/blog/defining-a-critical-css-workflow-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Defining a Critical CSS Workflow for WordPress</a>, <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com/blog/acf-gutenberg-blocks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ACF Guten Blocks</a>, and <a href="https://kingdesignllc.com/blog/scrolling-the-fold/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrolling & the Fold</a>. </p>
